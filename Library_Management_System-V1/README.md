## Library Information Management System

### 1. Reasons for this project.

I am a college student about to enter my junior year. I have sorted out the course design I have done since I entered the university and made it here as an open source to commemorate my university life. Of course, there are other open source code, thanks for letting me learn a lot from it, next I will live up to the youth, brutal growth. I began to prepare for the postgraduate entrance exam!

### 2. Comments and Considerations

* The enviroment I developed this project on Windows that time. So if you are Linux or macOS user, maybe you can't run this project code normally. 

* Do your homework for yourself. You can learn for reference, but it's better not to plagiarize.

### 3. Encoding format

.C Text is encoded with **UTF-8**, But the .text Text is encoded with **GBK**. Maybe you will find error about text format. You can change all text format to **UTF-8**, maybe solve it.

### 4. Support

Compile Enviorment:
  1. windows 10 && Gcc 5.11 (ensure OK! But have some warnings.)

### 5. OriginalCoder
